PocketBase on Gitpod
This repository sets up a PocketBase instance hosted on Gitpod, providing a lightweight, self-hosted backend-as-a-service with a real-time database, authentication, file storage, and an admin dashboard. With just a few clicks, you can spin up a fully functional PocketBase server in the cloud using Gitpod's development environment.
Features

PocketBase: A Go-based backend with SQLite, offering REST API, real-time subscriptions, and file management.
Gitpod Integration: Automated setup via .gitpod.yml for instant deployment.
Accessible Admin UI: Access the PocketBase admin dashboard via Gitpod's preview URL on port 8090.
Portable & Reproducible: Fork the repo, open in Gitpod, and have a running backend in seconds.

Prerequisites

A GitHub account.
Access to Gitpod (free tier is sufficient for this setup).
Basic familiarity with PocketBase and Gitpod.

Getting Started
1. Fork the Repository
To use or modify this PocketBase setup:

Go to the repository page.
Click the Fork button in the top-right corner to create a copy under your GitHub account.

Replace YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY with the actual GitHub username and repository name.
2. Open in Gitpod
Launch the forked repository in Gitpod:

Navigate to your forked repo (e.g., https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY).

Prepend https://gitpod.io/# to the repo URL, like this:
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY


Open the URL in a browser, or use the button below if added to the repo:


Gitpod will set up the workspace, start the PocketBase server, and open a preview on port 8090.


3. Access the Admin Dashboard

In the Gitpod workspace, the preview window will show the PocketBase admin UI at http://localhost:8090.
Create an admin account by following the prompts to set an email and password.
Log in to manage collections, users, and files.

4. Use the API
Interact with PocketBase via:

REST API at http://localhost:8090/api/ using tools like cURL or Postman.
PocketBase JS SDK for frontend apps.
PocketBase Go SDK for server-side integration.

See the PocketBase documentation for more details.

Notes

Data Persistence: Data is stored in SQLite within the Gitpod workspace. If the workspace is deleted, data may be lost. For persistent storage, consider external database solutions or manual backups.
Customizations: Extend PocketBase with custom routes or logic by adding JavaScript or Go code (see PocketBase docs).
Security: The admin dashboard is publicly accessible in Gitpodâ€™s preview. Secure your instance by setting strong admin credentials and restricting access if needed.
